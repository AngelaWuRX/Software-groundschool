# Software groundschool
Hello! Welcome to my Skill Boosters. I will keep my notes here.

## Week 1
1. What software is on our current drone? (Summary of the next 5 weeks)
NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano
- Week 4 Flight controller
- Week 3 Object detection
- Week 2 Aerial Imagery
2. What kinds of challenges/projects can YOU work on as a Software team member?
- Improve flight controller: reinforcement learning research
- Computer vision: revamp stitching code
- Applications: 3D mapping for enviro research purposes!
- ** research random thing: Deep Learning**
3. What’s the “industry standard” for drone software in 2025?
- Flight software: ROS 2-based, highly modular, PX4 for FC
- Real-time autonomy: Advanced SLAM, path planning, AI inference
- Compliance and safety: Automated risk assessments, airspace alerts
- Data integration: cloud stuff
4. How does one learn about drones effectively in 2025?
- Talk back and forth with AI to make sure you understand it at a broad level
- Set goals and DO PROJECTS. 
- Find ways of tracking your progress so you stay encouraged and feel like you’re doing something
- For individual details, a combination of AI and fact-checking on individual sites/personal experience is best. AI isn’t perfect with specifics.
- Reach out to your friends/us if you need help
